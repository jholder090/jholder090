**`A full-stack software developer eager to learn and grow as much as I can`**

I'm a budding full-stack developer just trying to take it all in and learn as much as possible. I love frontend development where I can watch the beauty of my projects unfold as I go.

## So, what am I currently working on?
- :princess: An e-commerce application for a friend of mine (check out my Halie project!)
- Learning the basics of leveraging AWS for web app and data hosting
